## Notes

* Starting with an already existing repo was a bit challenging but I began cutting the challenges in small problems
* Nesting components, I haven't added components as the code wasn't long enough so it didn't deem necessary.
* Using json instead of a variable with the quotes and answers.
* Disabling the button to not allow user to manipulate streaks.
* Finding ways to use the lab to help me with implementing what's needed in my project.
